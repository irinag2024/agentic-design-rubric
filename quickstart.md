# Quick Start

This guide helps you apply the AI Agent Design Rubric to your own project in a few minutes.

## Step 1. Download the rubric

Download the rubric file from this repository.  
It does not need to be added to your project, but it must be accessible to your coding assistant.

## Step 2. Open your agent repository in a coding assistant

Open your own project in a tool such as:
- Claude Code  
- Cursor  
- GitHub Copilot Workspace  
- VS Code AI Extension  

Different assistants may interpret prompts differently.  
Adjust the wording if needed for your tool.

## Step 3. Run this prompt (and update the rubric path)

Replace `<PATH_TO_RUBRIC_FILE>` with the actual path to the rubric on your machine.

> Scan this repository and evaluate the agent design.  
> Use only code, tests, and configuration files. Ignore all documentation, comments, and markdown files when scoring.  
> Use the rubric at `<PATH_TO_RUBRIC_FILE>` as the scoring reference.  
> If something is described only in documentation and not present in code, treat it as not implemented.

## Step 4. Review the generated assessment

Use the output as a first pass and adjust scores where needed.

## Step 5. Capture your results

Record your final scores and notes using your preferred format.
